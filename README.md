# Algorithms and Data Structures

I've been using the book [A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/book/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition)
for my own self education. This repository is a collection of the same algorithms
and data structures from the book I made to help solidify my learning. I've also
been learning the Scala programming language and this has been a useful exercise
to learn the language.

The work in this repository is intended for educational purposes and should not
be considered fit for production use.
